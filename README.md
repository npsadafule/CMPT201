# CMPT201
This repository contains all the work I did towards CMPT201 - Systems Programming in Fall 2024

### Short Assignments

The first type of assignments in this course is short assignments.

* In the first few weeks of the course, students are expected to finish *two* short assignments per
  week.
* Each short assignment is in the style of a tutorial and takes about 2-3 hours to complete.
* These assignments are designed to teach students basic tools and concepts that students use for
  in-class activities and long assignments.
* Unlike long assignments, short assignments are designed to be straightforward.

Below are the short assignments, provided for your reference. Each offering of CMPT 201 has its own
private repos for these assignments and instructions may vary slightly. Therefore, if you are taking
CMPT 201, please make sure you use the correct repos corresponding to your term instead of the
repos below.

* [A1: Neovim](https://github.com/SFU-CMPT-201/a1-pub)

* [A7: More on Memory Layout, Data Types, and Alignment](https://github.com/SFU-CMPT-201/a7-pub)

### Long Assignments

The second type of assignments in this course is long assignments.

* Long assignments are *exponentially* more challenging than short ones, specifically designed to
  push students to test and enhance their programming skills.
* The expectation is that each assignment will take 15-20 hours to complete. However, students
  sometimes report spending 30-40 hours on each long assignment. This discrepancy is likely due to
  varying levels of preparedness with the prerequisites.
* In other words, the level of challenge posed by the assignments can vary significantly, depending
  on the student's stage of proficiency in general programming and their understanding of the
  prerequisite materials (e.g., beginner-beginner, intermediate-beginner, advanced-beginner).
* Long assignments typically do not provide a detailed step-by-step guide. Students are expected to
  *figure things out* independently. The course is designed to train and challenge students,
  fostering self-reliance and problem-solving skills.

Below are the long assignments, provided for your reference. Each offering of CMPT 201 has its own
private repos for these assignments and instructions may vary slightly. Therefore, if you are taking
CMPT 201, please make sure you use the correct repos corresponding to your term instead of the repos
below.

* [A8: Simple Shell](https://github.com/SFU-CMPT-201/a8-pub)
* [A9: Memory Management](https://github.com/SFU-CMPT-201/a9-pub)
* [A10: Simple MapReduce](https://github.com/SFU-CMPT-201/a10-pub)
